# Overview
[CompTIA A+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/a) is the only industry recognized credential with performance testing to prove pros can think on their feet to perform critical IT support tasks. It is trusted by employers around the world to identify the go-to person in end point management & technical support roles. CompTIA A+ appears in more tech support job listings than any other IT credential. The CompTIA A+ Core Series requires candidates to pass two exams: Core 1 and Core 2.

This repository provides notes that I've constructed while studying for the A+ exam. These notes are designed to be supplementary study material. This repository is in no way affiliated with CompTIA or Pearson VUE and makes no guarantees of accuracy or completeness.
